description: The identifiers used in the database

## Fun Maths

The database has many structures, but they all will typically have an "id" value. This is a unique identifier for each object in the database. The ID is generated using the function:

<LatexRenderer formula="\Huge \lfloor e^{X} \cdot 9999 \rfloor \text{ where } X \sim U(0,1)" />

or in other words - the nearest integer value of e raised to a random decimal between 0 and 1 multiplied by 9,999. Basically just generates a random ID. This is used to uniquely identify each object in the database.

## Get Started!

Welcome to the docs! YABGSMS is a simple GraphQL server that allows you to create, read, update, and delete posts and users. It is built using [Fumadocs](https://fumadocs.vercel.app) and [GraphQL](https://graphql.org) / [ApolloServer](https://apollographql.com).

You can play around with the server using the GraphQL Client on the [Cloudflare Worker](https://yabgsms.tgca211859.workers.dev/). Some endpoints require an admin token, which is just the header `Authorization: secret` for now (just a basic placeholder for showcase purposes)

The server is divided in two simple parts: Posts and Users. You can create, read, update, and delete both of them.

<Cards>
  <Card title="Posts" href="/docs/posts" icon={<Rss />}>
    Posts are simple. They have an ID, an author, a title, and content. The content can be either an image or text.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Users" href="/docs/users" icon={<Users/>}>
    Users are also simple. They have a username, a full name, and an ID.
  </Card>
</Cards>

## Schema

Below is the entire schema for the server. You can use this to understand how the server works, and how to interact with it.

```gql
type User {
  id: Int!
  username: String!
  fullName: String!
}

type Post {
  id: Int!
  author: Int!
  title: String!
  content: PostContent!
}

type PostContent {
  type: PostContentType!
  data: String!
}

enum PostContentType {
  IMAGE,
  TEXT
}

type Query {
  users: [User]
  posts: [Post]
  post(id: Int!): Post
  user(id: Int!): User
}

type Mutation {
  createUser(username: String!, fullName: String!): User
  deleteUser(id: Int!): Boolean!
  updateUserName(id: Int!, username: String!): User
  updateUserFullName(id: Int!, fullName: String!): User

  createPost(author: Int!, title: String!, contentType: PostContentType!, content: String!): Post
  deletePost(id: Int!): Boolean!
  updatePostTitle(id: Int!, title: String!): Post
  updatePostContent(id: Int!, contentType: PostContentType!, content: String!): Post
}
```

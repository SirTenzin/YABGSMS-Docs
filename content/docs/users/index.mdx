## User structure

Users are pretty simple. They have a username and a full name, and an ID. You can create, read, update, and delete users via their unique Identifier.

<Callout title="Note">You can view how these IDs are generated at the [Identifiers](/docs/id) page</Callout>

## Watch out!

<Callout type="warn" title="Authenticating">You must be authorized to perform these actions. You can simple use the placeholder token by setting the `Authorization` header to `secret`</Callout>

## Schema: 

```gql
type User {
    id: Int!
    username: String!
    fullName: String!
}
```

You can run the following GraphQL query to create a user with the name "John Doe" and the username "john_d03":

```gql
mutation {
  createUserSuccess: createUser(
    username: "john_d03", 
    fullName: "John Doe") {
    	id
  	}
}
```

On success, this will return: 

```json
{
  "data": {
    "createUserSuccess": {
      "id": 1234,
      "fullName": "John Day",
      "username": "john_d03"
    }
  }
}
```

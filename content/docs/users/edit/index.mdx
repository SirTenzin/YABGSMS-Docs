## Mutating users

The GraphQL server has several mutators (functions that change data) that allow you to edit users. They are very simple to use and are as follows according to the schema.

## Schema

```gql
type Mutation {
	createUser(username: String!, fullName: String!): User
	deleteUser(id: Int!): Boolean!
	updateUserName(id: Int!, username: String!): User
	updateUserFullName(id: Int!, fullName: String!): User

	# ...
    # Post mutations omitted for brevity
}
```

## Aw Crud! (Mutating posts)

The GraphQL server has several mutators (functions that change data) that allow you to edit posts. They are very simple to use and are as follows according to the schema.

## Schema

```gql
type Mutation {
	# ...
    # User mutations omitted for brevity

	createPost(
		author: Int!
		title: String!
		contentType: PostContentType!
		content: String!
	): Post
	deletePost(id: Int!): Boolean!
	updatePostTitle(id: Int!, title: String!): Post
	updatePostContent(
		id: Int!
		contentType: PostContentType!
		content: String!
	): Post
}
```

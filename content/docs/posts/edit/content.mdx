## Editing a post's content

You can update any post's content using the following GraphQL query. This will overwrite the content type and data, for example:

```json
{
  "id": 2,
  "author": 1,
  "title": "The best social media app's first image post!",
  "content": {
    "type": "TEXT",
    "data": "This is the first post on this social media app with a picture. How amazing is this?"
  }
}
```

will be mapped under the following query

```gql
mutation UpdatePostContent($updatePostContentId: Int!, $contentType: PostContentType!, $content: String!) {
  updatePostContent(id: $updatePostContentId, contentType: $contentType, content: $content) {
    id, title, author, content {
      type, data
    }
  }
}
```

onto the new post object: 

```json
{
  "data": {
    "updatePostContent": {
      "id": 2,
      "title": "The best social media app's first image post!",
      "author": 1,
      "content": {
        "type": "IMAGE",
        "data": "image.com"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

This is particularly useful when you want to change the type of content in a post, for example, from text to an image or vice versa.
